# Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification using Gene Expression Data

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **prostate cancer risk stratification** using gene expression data and machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to identify molecular patterns that distinguish tumor and normal samples at both **gene-level** and **pathway-level**.

Dataset source: **GEO (GSE6919)**
